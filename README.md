    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
This will include the SecurityAutoConfiguration class â€“ containing the initial/default security configuration.
By default, the application will get Basic Authentication enabled. There are some predefined properties, such as:
spring.security.user.name=user
spring.security.password=password
security.basic.enabled=true
